    <h1>Hotel Booking Dataset Analysis</h1>

   <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions!</p>
    <p>This dataset contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes various attributes such as booking dates, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. Please note that all personally identifying information has been removed from the data to protect privacy.</p>

   <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>The objective of this project is to explore and analyze the dataset to discover important factors that govern hotel bookings. By analyzing this data, you can gain insights into the following questions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>What is the best time of year to book a hotel room for the best rates?</li>
        <li>How does the length of stay affect the daily rate?</li>
        <li>What factors contribute to a higher likelihood of receiving special requests?</li>
        <li>Are there any notable trends or patterns based on the type of hotel (city hotel or resort hotel)?</li>
    </ol>

   <h2>Getting Started</h2>
